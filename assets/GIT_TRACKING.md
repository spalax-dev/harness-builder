# Git tracking contract

> What belongs in git and what stays local. This is part of the harness contract:
> a clean repository is a gate, not a preference.

Read this before creating `.gitignore`. Start from `assets/gitignore.tmpl` and use
`assets/ignores.txt` for formatter/linter/structure walks.

## Track

| Path / kind | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `BACKLOG.md` | User stories; they are the product's memory |
| `.harness/state.json` | The stage is a project decision, shared by every clone |
| `docs/planning/**` | Overview, architecture, stack, contracts, C4, sequences, ADRs |
| `docs/harness/**` | How verification works |
| `AGENTS.md` | The agent entry point |
| `.opencode/agent/*.md` | Orchestrator and executor roles |
| `.opencode/plugins/harness-guard.js` | Protocol enforcement |
| `opencode.json` (if used) | Shared safety and permission config |
| `scripts/harness.mjs`, `harness-lib.mjs`, `harness-lib.spec.mjs`, `build_harness.mjs` | The executable harness |
| Source code and tests | The product |
| Package manifests and **one** lockfile | Reproducible installs |
| Formatter/linter/type/test config | The gates depend on them |
| `.gitignore`, `.prettierignore`, `.eslintignore` | The ignore policy |
| `progress/history.md` | Durable session record |
| `progress/explore/.gitkeep` | Keeps the research folder |
| `.env.example` (no secrets) | Documents required configuration |

## Do not track (local only)

| Path / kind | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `activities.json` | Execution state of one story; regenerated per story and prone to conflicts |
| `.harness/schedule.json` | Computed on every `--schedule` |
| `.harness/claims/**` | Live executor claims |
| `.harness/approvals.json` | Local approval cache; the durable proof is in `progress/history.md` |
| `progress/current.md` | Live session state |
| Generated documentation (`docs/api/`, `docs/site/`, `site/`, `_build/`) | Build output; regenerate it |
| `node_modules/`, `.pnpm-store/`, `.venv/`, `vendor/` | Reproducible from the lockfile |
| `dist/`, `build/`, `out/`, `target/`, `bin/`, `obj/` | Generated build output |
| Framework/test caches | Regenerable |
| `*.log`, `*.tmp`, `.DS_Store` | Local noise |
| `.env`, `.env.*` (except `.env.example`), keys, credentials, service-account JSON | Secrets never enter git |
| Project-local state | Runtime state; add the project's own path |

## The stage record is tracked on purpose

`activities.json` and `progress/current.md` are local because they change
constantly and belong to one working session. `.harness/state.json` is different:
`planning → development` is a decision the whole project shares. Tracking it
means a fresh clone knows it cannot re-enter planning. Do not ignore it.

## Verify the policy

```bash
git status --short
git status --ignored --short | head -40
git check-ignore -v activities.json .harness/schedule.json progress/current.md
git ls-files .harness/ docs/planning/ progress/
```

Expected: `.harness/state.json`, `docs/planning/**`, `BACKLOG.md` and
`progress/history.md` are tracked; `activities.json`, the schedule, claims,
approvals and `current.md` are ignored; no secrets in `git status`.

## Rules

1. Never commit a secret, token, private key or credential file.
2. Never commit generated documentation or build output.
3. Commit one lockfile; do not commit multiple package-manager locks.
4. `progress/history.md` is append-only.
5. A story closes only with the user's approval recorded in `history.md`.
6. If the tracking policy changes, update this file and `.gitignore` together.
